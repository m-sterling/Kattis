My solutions to various problems on [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com).

Solutions are labeled by their problem's ID slug found in the sidebar of the problem's page. For example, [hello.py](code/hello.py) corresponds to the [Hello World!](https://open.kattis.com/problems/hello) problem, which has the slug `hello`.
